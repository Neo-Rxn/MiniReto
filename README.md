# MiniReto

This is a Mini Challenge for the second Sprint of Semillero de Desarrolladores.
The goal of this challenge is to recreate a hotel finder web site, where the user
selects the image of the hotel by clicking over it, and then the content of the
page changes accordingly to the selected hotels.
<br>
So the name of the hotel, location an description gets updated on click over
the image.
<br>
Other feature required by the challenge, is to hide/show the nav bar when the user 
click over it
<br>
